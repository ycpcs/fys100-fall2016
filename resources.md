This page has links to resources we will be using in the course.

[Processing](http://processing.org) &mdash; This is the programming language and environment we will be using for labs and projects.  I encourage you to download it and install it on your own computer.  *Important*: Make sure you get the latest version (3.0 beta 5 or later).

[Audacity](http://audacityteam.org/) &mdash; A free, open-source audio recording and editing program.  This is handy for editing samples, finding parts of samples to play, saving audio clips in different formats, etc.
