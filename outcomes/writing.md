title: "Effective Writing"
---

You will be doing a significant amount of writing in this FYS course and in other courses throughout your college career.

This document describes some of the qualities of effective written communication and how you can achieve them.

**Use clear language.**  The goal of written communication is to convey your thoughts and ideas.  You won't do this effectively if it's hard for the reader to figure out what you're trying to say.  So, use language as clearly, directly, and precisely as you can.  Use correct grammar.  Make your phrases and sentences as simple as possible.  Use fancy words sparingly, and when you do use them, use them correctly.  Avoid passive voice.

**Organize your ideas.**  Every written work needs a structure.  Topics should flow smoothly and should build towards a conclusion.  You should [make an outline](outline.html) before you start writing.  "Stream of consciousness" (?) writing might be helpful when you are getting your ideas down, but in general will lead to poor organization.

**Think about your audience.**

**Proofread and revise.**

**Use the Writing Center.**  The Writing Center (TODO, need a link) is an excellent resource for getting help on your writing assignments.  Make an appointment to discuss your work with a tutor.
