# Learning goals

* Utilize software and hardware to express and design an interactive art installation

* Reflect upon your experience and discuss artistic and techincal accomplishments and challenges

# Computing as a Material
This installiation assignment requires you to utilize the skills developed in class to create an interactive art installation. This exhibit will be composed by a team of 2-3 students and will reflect an intentional design to convey an artistic experience. Students should explore how the different themes discussed in class (animiation, sound, big data, and physical computing) can be combined to create new, engaging, and thought provoking interactions.

# Deliverables

There are several deliverables for this assignment including proposals, demos, and technical reports. Create a folder called 'Assignment 6' on your Google Drive to submit the electronic elements.

# Proposal

As part of Assignment 6, please provide a short proposal for your final creative computing project. Using the major course topics of animation, sound, science/literature, and physical interaction, envision an installation or project that you wish to create. 

For this initial assignment, create a proposal such that Dr. Hovermeyer and myself can evaluate whether the project is feasible within the class. We will then review your proposal and provide feedback. 

In the proposal: 

* describe the project vision, including its interactions, responses, data sources...etc
* the equipment you believe you will need
* the 2-3 members of the team. 
  
Submit this information as a 2-3 paragraph document covering these items to Google Drive by 11:59 pm on Thursday, November 17th. Note: it is possible that we can purchase additional hardware for your projects ($20-30/team). 

# Sketch and Code Outline
Develop a high-level diagram showing the major components of your project and some initial sketches regarding the code that will be created.

Due Nov 28th by 11:59pm

# Initial Prototype and Demo
Provide an initial demo of your installation to the course instructors in class. Use this feedback to iterate for your final installation.

Due Dec 6th in class.

# Final Presentation and Exhibition
Provide a final demo and presentation to the instructors and your classmates showing your work. 

10:15&ndash;12:15 on Saturday, Dec 17th (during the scheduled final exam period.)

# Technical Report and Reflection
Submit a technical report describing your installation's operation and your reflections regarding the process. More specific details TBD.

Due Dec 14th at 11:59pm.
