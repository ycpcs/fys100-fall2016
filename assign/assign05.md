* Construct an argument based on evidence
* Find sources of evidence
* Cite sources

# Can computers be creative?

This writing assignment is a continuation of the discussion of the MELOMICS project, as we discussed in the [Music discussion day](../agenda/day13.html).  You will investigate whether it is possible for computers to exhibit creativity, specifically in the area of music composition.

# Deliverables

Create a folder called `Assignment 5` in your shared Google drive folder.  All of your deliverables for this assignment should be placed in this folder.

## Annotated bibliography

This deliverable should be a document called `Annotated bibliography`.

You annotated bibliography is a list of sources you will use as evidence in making your argument.

We suggest that you start with the MELOMICS project sources (see the [Schedule](../schedule.html).

In addition, you must find at least *one* information source beyond the MELOMICS sources.

Your annotated bibliography should list each source you will use, and briefly summarize the information in the source and assess the degree of credibility of the source.  (I.e., if you think it is possible that the source might be biased in some way, state this.)

## Outline

This deliverable should be a document called `Essay outline`.

The outline should indicate how your essay will be organized, and should briefly summarize what information you will provide in each section of the essay.  The outline should also give an overall sense of your argument and what evidence you will use to support it.

## Essay Draft

This deliverable should be a document called `Essay draft`.

The draft should substantially address the expectations of the essay (see below.)

## Essay

Your task is to write an essay arguing one of the following positions:

* Computers will never be able to compose music as well as human beings
* Computers cannot currently compose music as well as human beings, but someday they will
* Computers have reached the point where they can compose music as well as or better than human beings

Cite specific evidence supporting your position.  I would encourage you to use the reading/documentary/album from the music discussion day.  In addition, you are required to find *at least one additional source* to support your position.

Your essay must use [MLA format](https://www.library.cornell.edu/research/citation/mla) for sources.  Use citations as appropriate in your text when you refer to evidence in the sources you are using to support your argument.  Make sure that you have a list of works cited at the end of your essay.

Your essay should be *at least* two pages, not including the list of works cited.

Create your essay draft and final version as documents in your shared Google Drive folder.  The documents should be called **Writing Assignment 2 (draft)** and **Writing Assignment 2 (final)**, respectively.

# Grading 

Your essay will be graded as follows:

* Stating your position: up to 15 points
* Arguments in support of your position: up to 40 points
* Citing appropriate evidence (including at least one additional source): up to 15 points
* Conclusions: up to 15 points
* List of works cited: up to 15 points
