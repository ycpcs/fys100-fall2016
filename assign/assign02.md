# Getting started

Start Processing.  You should see an empty Processing window.  Copy and paste the following code into the window:

{% highlight java %}
void setup() {
  size(800, 600);
  background(255);
  noLoop();
}

void draw() {
  fill(255);
  stroke(0);
  strokeWeight(1);
  
  // TODO: add drawing operations
}
{% endhighlight %}

Choose **File &rarr; Save As...**.  Make sure that your sketchbook folder (`H:\sketchbook`) is selected as the folder.)  In the **Selection** text box, enter **VisualArtProject**.  Click **OK**.

Congratulations!  You have created a Processing sketch called **VisualArtProject**.
