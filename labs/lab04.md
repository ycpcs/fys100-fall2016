# Learning goals

* Use turtle graphics and Processing drawing functions to generate images from simple rules
* Appreciate how self-similarity at varying scales leads to "natural"-looking images
* Understand how to use a recursive method to generate a fractal image

# What to do

## Part 1: Turtle graphics basics

Instructions for downloading and running the example sketch.

Brief explanation of the program.

Things to change, see what happens.

Ideas for things to change.

## Part 2: Experiment!

Goal: modify the fractals in the example program to produce some interesting visual effects.

TODO: suggest some ideas to try out.
