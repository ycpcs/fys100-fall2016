# Learning goals

* Use *procedural abstraction* to avoid repeated code when drawing similar or identical elements
* Use loops to avoid repeated code when the same drawing operation is being executed with coordinates and/or dimensions that vary in a predictable way

# What to do

## Part 1: Using functions

Instructions for downloading and running the example sketch.

Brief explanation of the program.

Things to change, see what happens.

Ideas for things to change.

## Part 2: Using a function to draw repeated elements in your sketch

Instructions for opening the sketch started in Lab 1.

Goal: create a function to draw a repeated element, use it.
